Spotify stumbled after its first quarterly report since joining the stock market. Tesla shares were down after Elon Musk’s unusual earnings call. Snap hit a record low after failing to gain traction with its redesign.

Apple, however, surprised Wall Street when iPhone sales didn’t disappoint. We also recapped the successful IPOs for DocuSign and Smartsheet.

Our special guest this week was M.G. Siegler, general partner at GV (formerly Google Ventures). In a previous life, he wrote for TechCrunch.

We also had TechCrunch editor Connie Loizos, who will be helping out with the show now that I’m leaving. Yes, that’s right, I’m sad to say that it’s my last episode of “Equity.”

I’ve accepted a new opportunity that I’m excited about (announcing it soon), but I will miss the fun times we’ve had on the show.

Somehow we’ve managed to have over a million downloads since launching “Equity” in March of last year. Thank you for tuning in!

And don’t worry, the show will go on. The remaining “Equity” crew will keep you informed.

The round, led by Tencent and a whole slew of other investors, follows a $100 million Series B and $20 million Series C.

The bipedal robotics maker certainly isn’t a household name here in the States — though the company’s taken a few baby steps over here, including a walking Stormtrooper robot released alongside The Last Jedi. It also debuted a “robotic butler” with a tablet face back at CES in January that seemed more proof of concept than shipping product — though UBTECH has promised a broad 2019 release date.

CEO James Zhou has promised the company will use this huge backing to accelerate its vision of bringing robots into the home.

“As technology evolves to include more voice and touch capabilities, people need new devices that communicate and interact more naturally and intuitively at home, at school and at work,” he said in a release tied to the announcement. “While trends in robots and robotics are developing, no company has yet stepped forward with the resources, vision and products ecosystem to transform robot fantasy and fiction into robot reality. UBTECH is bringing this reality to life by expanding the possibilities for innovation.”

The company says the funding will go into R&D, hires and expanding its global footprint. UBTECH is one of a number of companies pushing home robotics beyond the Roomba, including a rumored upcoming device from Amazon. The technology has been a tough nut to crack in the preceding decades, but an $820 million investment certainly couldn’t hurt.There will be no “Vine 2” — at least for now. Trying to take on the giant social networks without external funding proved too tall a task for six-second video app Vine’s co-founder Dom Hofmann. “I’ve made the very difficult decision of postponing the V2 project for an indefinite amount of time. There are several reasons for this, including a bit of ‘sequelitis’, but I’d like to explain the biggest one, which is due to financial and legal hurdles,” Hofmann wrote on the community forums he set up for V2.

Announced in late December out of his frustration regarding how Twitter neglected and eventually shut down Vine, Hofmann had since built a creative tool startup called Byte, and is still leading a virtual reality company called Interspace, but was trying to run V2 as a self-funded personal project on the side. The plan was to launch in 2018 with an app that let you record or upload 2 to 6-second looping videos and much stronger anti-harassment safety features.

But without millions in outside investment, it was an insurmountable task to develop the app, host the videos and grow the audience. While Hofmann didn’t specify, it seems Twitter wasn’t happy about him using the name V2 and an almost identical logo. “The interest has been extremely encouraging, but it has also created some roadblocks . . . The attention has also raised an issue that we might not have faced otherwise: legal fees have been overwhelming,” Hofmann wrote. We’ve asked him and Twitter if Twitter was suing or threatening legal action against Hofmann or V2.

While there’s still no ubiquitous way to share super-short videos, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube are no paltry competitors. So now, Hofmann says, “We take a step back. The code and ideas still exist, but until everything else comes together, we can’t move forward. Again, this is indefinite, which means that it could take a long time. But it’s necessary.”

You can read Hofmann’s full announcement here:Only a couple of days before Google I/O 2018, one of the biggest VR announcements from last year’s developer conference is finally coming to light. Lenovo’s Mirage headset is now on sale for $399. The standalone device is unique largely because of its inside-out tracking, a technology that has not been available on a VR headset widely sold stateside.

The Mirage Solo arrives just a couple of days after Facebook opened sales of the much cheaper $199 Oculus Go, so how does the Daydream headset that’s double the price stack up?

Well first off, Google’s WorldSense tracking is wildly impressive. The inside-out tracking tech is among the best I’ve ever demoed on a headset. While playing titles like Extreme Whiteout, I was able to use the headset’s tracking to move from side to side while skiing down a mountain; Merry Snowballs gave me the ability to dodge snowballs while firing my own at pesky kids using the standard Daydream controller.

The build of the headset is pretty solid. Bulkiness and a lack of sexiness are foregone conclusions for VR tech in general right now, and yes, this rig also has those issues. While the rigid PSVR-like visor head strap is certainly very comfortable, it also makes the headset a bit difficult to transport, which is arguably pretty essential to a standalone VR headset. I wish there was integrated audio, but the headset does include some little earbuds.

The headset charges via USB-C and has a microSD card slot that can expand its 64GB of onboard memory. A big advantage this headset has over others is its battery life, which spans two or three hours of gameplay on a charge, which seems good enough for sure.

The titles that make specific use of WorldSense certainly gain something new, but it still feels as though the tech is wasted on a platform that limits your movements so heavily to only a step or two in each direction. While the Mirage headset operates on Snapdragon’s 835 chipset, unlike Qualcomm’s own 835 VR platform, a Google employee tells me WorldSense on Mirage could be capable of full room-scale tracking.

This limitation is hardly Lenovo’s fault; Google should have waited another year and introduced a more defined high-end platform that integrated tracked controllers. Instead, what we’re left with is a piece of hardware that’s capable of so much but is limited by the content platform that has to optimize for the lowest common denominator. This may have worked better had HTC launched its Vive Focus on the Daydream platform as was originally planned, but it seems the struggling Taiwanese tech company realized that hardware margins would be tight and they had little to gain unless they owned the platform.

This all leaves Lenovo in a shitty, yet familiar, position where they are the first to buy into an “emerging” Google platform but are left as the only entrant. Just as Lenovo’s Phab 2 Pro was the first (of two) smartphones to build in Tango AR functionality, without other WorldSense headsets, developers are going to have a tough time justifying building apps that make extensive use of the WorldSense feature. If that happens, the headset-tracking will turn into a feature that is mainly one for comfort, rather than changing gameplay.

Compared to the standalone headsets that have come before it, the Lenovo Mirage is a steal at $399, but with the $199 Oculus Go launching this week as well, I have a tough time recommending the Mirage over the Go. Oculus has invested so much more time into its core apps than Google has, and while the WorldSense positional tracking is exceptionally impressive from a tech perspective, without tracked controllers the experience for the end consumer is only improved a bit.After a quarter of a century, Richmond, Calif.’s 500,000-square-foot Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant stopped making cars around the mid-1950s. These days, the space is home to a broad range of companies, including Mountain Hardwear and solar panel manufacturer, SunPower. But there is, perhaps, no tenant more suited for the space than Ekso Bionics.

Founded in 2005 as a spin-off of UC Berkeley’s Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory, the company creates soft exoskeletons, designed to aid factory workers in tedious, repetitive and taxing tasks.

Late last year, the startup fittingly partnered with Ford, bringing its wearable robotic suits to Michigan factory workers. The deal, paid for by the United Auto Workers union, will lead to the EksoVest’s deployment in factories all over the world. But Ekso’s focus moves beyond the factory walls. As with so many other robotics companies, it began life in pursuit of military funding.

“Originally the company was about helping soldiers carry heavy equipment in the field. One of the founder’s brother was a Navy Seal,” explains Ekso CFO Max Scheder-Bieschin. “He was injured and became a quadriplegic. It pivoted from ‘how do I build things to help my brother serve our country’ to ‘how do I help my brother and other quadriplegics get up and walking again’ with that same technology.”

The company’s Ekso Health line focuses on rehabilitation. Ekso’s suits offer lightweight, wearable assistance to patients suffering mobility setbacks from things like strokes.

But Scheder-Bieschin says the company envisions a world in the not so distant future when the technology is a ubiquitous part of our lives. “In 10 years, exoskeletons are going to be analogous to the smartphone today,” the executive explains. “One of the things that distinguishes Ekso is that we know how to wrap a robot around a human, and we do it better than anybody else.”

The investors behind them are often pretty interesting, too, given the expertise needed to make informed bets on what are often completely unproven projects.

Such is the case with Foresite Capital, a seven-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit that just closed on $668 million for its fourth venture fund, its biggest pool of capital so far. (Its first funds closed with $100 million, $300 million, and $450 million, respectively.)

The firm was founded by Jim Tananbaum, who has started and sold healthcare companies and who earned the dubious distinction — courtesy of Bloomberg — of symbolizing what’s gone wrong with the Burning Man festival in recent years. (Months after Bloomberg described an elaborate camp he had built, Tananbaum, who in 2014 was elected to the board of the nonprofit that oversees the event, resigned.)

No doubt Tananbaum — who has both an MD and an MBA from Harvard — would prefer to be known for being named to Forbes’ Midas List of top venture capitalists for the last four years, thanks to a wide array of bets in Foresite’s portfolio. Some of these include Aimmune Therapeutics, whose treatment to protect children with food allergies is seeking FDA approval; Puma Biotech and Juno Therapeutics, both of which have gone recent public in recent years; and Intarcia Therapeutics, which makes a matchstick-size, diabetes-treating pump and was flying high two years ago, though it has more recently taken its lumps.

Foresite’s approach has impressed more than Forbes. Last year, Tananbaum also recruited recruited Vik Bajaj, who co-founded Alphabet’s life sciences arm Verily and was formerly the chief scientific officer of Grail, a well-funded company that’s developing a blood test to detect cancer in its earliest stages.

Bajaj — who’d earlier in his career spent seven years as a scientist with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — presumably could have landed at another venture firm, a growing number of which are making life sciences investments. But he says Foresite’s 40-person team of largely researchers was one major draw. As Tananbaum describes it, the group tracks data “ranging from the technical to R&D to patient/payer information, analyzing how each company compares technically and whether they’re meeting a significant patient need and is sustainable.”

Says Bajaj of the multi-stage firm, whose checks range in size from $1 million, all the way to $50 million: “The amount of data to inform decisions in bio medical investing is enormous, from biological to preclinical and clinical data, to data about how products are going to be marketed and used and approved by regulators. Each of these features is associated with massive data sets, and you have to have a degree of scientific depth and rigor — and that’s the culture that Jim set up here from the beginning.”

Foresite is managing by five general partner investors altogether. They write roughly a dozen checks each year, and generally target 10 percent ownership, say both men.

Some of Foresite’s other investments include the machine-learning drug R&D startup, insitro; Mindstrong, a mental health startup; and Denali Therapeutics, which is developing treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases and staged one of last year’s biggest biotech IPOs.Update: The Atlas V rocket lifted off on-time and is currently eleven minutes into the second stage of the flight, the booster having separated successfully…

Original story follows below…

Night owl? Good news — there’s an historic rocket launch early tomorrow morning that you can catch while the rest of the country is sleeping. NASA’s InSight Mars lander is scheduled for takeoff at 4:05 AM Pacific, weather permitting. You can watch it live at the links below.

InSight is launching atop an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur for the orbital stage, operated by United Launch Alliance. After a six-month trip through space, the mission is to discover the secrets lying deep within the Red Planet using sensitive seismographs and a temperature probe that will bore into the surface. There’s also a pair of CubeSats hitching a ride to test how tiny spacecraft will perform outside Earth’s orbit.

It’s historic not just because it’s an awesome Mars lander that will teach us about the formation of our rocky neighbor and Earth itself, but because this is the first time an interplanetary mission has taken off from the west coast of the country. It’s launching from Vandenberg air base, between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo (a couple hours north of LA, for those not familiar with Californian geography).

“If you live on the California Central Coast or south to L.A. and San Diego, be sure to get up early on May 5th, because Atlas V is the gold standard in launch vehicles and it can put on a great show,” said Kennedy Space Center launch director Tim Dunn in a NASA news release.

It’s launch week for @NASAInSight! Launch on #AtlasV is planned for 4:05amPDT on Saturday, May 5. Are you in SoCal? Here’s where the launch may be visible for you. pic.twitter.com/Pyncff3V1V — ULA (@ulalaunch) April 30, 2018

That all depends on the weather, of course. The dreaded marine layer lies heavy on the coast, and that means visibility will be extremely low. But as coastal Californians know, waiting for it to go away is a good way to waste a whole day. NASA can’t wait that long — the rocket needs to go off when this side of the planet is facing the right direction, of course. So Range Safety may waive the eyes-on visibility requirement for launch, provided all other telemetry systems are working normally.

Going from launch to orbit will take about 13 minutes, at which time InSight will wait for about an hour, and then a final burn will send it on its way to Mars. The whole process should take about 93 minutes.

So if you’re up tomorrow in the predawn hours, check out the launch either at NASA’s stream or at the YouTube hosted one that should appear here half an hour or so before launch.In a self-congratulatory statement, Carl Icahn compared the Xerox/Fujifilm story to television dramas like House of Cards and Billions. Certainly the whole thing has its share of twists and turns. Two days after dumping its CEO and board members, the company announced that its leadership is staying put for now.

“Xerox and its Board of Directors recognize the uncertainty caused by the developments of the past several days among the company’s investors and other stakeholders,” the company wrote in a statement issued last night. “The Xerox Board and management team remain focused on driving continued improvement in financial and operational performance, and will consider all options to create value for the company and its shareholders.”

Activist investors Icahn and Darwin Deason, who collectively control around 15 percent of Xerox stock, have been very vocal in their opposition to a merger with Fujifilm. The pact between Xerox and two of its three largest investors expired a mere 48 hours after being struck, but Icahn, unsurprisingly, has promised to continue the fight.

“The Xerox board recklessly refused to follow through with the leadership and governance changes we agreed to, demanding unprecedented additional approvals for their own personal self-interest,” Icahn said in a statement. “We will continue our fight to rescue and revitalize Xerox.”

All of this while a judge in New York has temporarily blocked the takeover plan, courtesy of a suit from Deason. Xerox followed up the executive reinstatement announcement with news of an appeal filed against the block.

“Xerox strongly believes that the decision is contrary to well-established New York law vesting the Board of Directors of Xerox with the business judgment to enter into the transaction agreement with Fujifilm and that the decision to approve should rest with Xerox’s shareholders, not the Court,” the company said in a follow-up statement.Timed with the release of the Mirage Solo headset, Lenovo is also releasing the first camera based on Google’s 180 tech. The Lenovo Mirage Camera, which seems to be geared heavily toward YouTube creators, packs a pair of fisheye 13MP lenses positioned about eyes-distance apart, allowing for high-quality 3D vision that’s perfect for VR viewing. At $299, the camera isn’t too expensive for creators looking to experiment, but it’s a worthy question of how big that niche really is. It starts shipping today.

The camera is based on YouTube’s VR180 platform, which is aiming to basically make capturing VR live-action content a little more palatable to creators. Indeed, 360-degree cameras have certainly gotten a lot of attention, but creators haven’t really figured out what to do with them for the most part. Google’s compromise here is to simplify the medium with a camera that shoots half as much but isn’t too expensive and delivers crisp 3D 4K video.

In terms of build, the camera is very nice. It doesn’t feel like it’s overtly high quality, but it’s solid enough and, most importantly, very pocketable. Like many 360 cameras, battery life isn’t awesome at two hours, but the battery can be swapped in and out and the camera comes with a spare, which is very nice. VR180 means 180 degrees, which you will understand in photos, especially if your finger creeps to the outer edge of the top of the camera — it will invade the 180 half-dome.

Users can utilize Google’s VR180 app to preview shots and live-stream footage from the camera.

It could all be a winning solution, but the question is really whether this product is popping up a little late. Tons of YouTube creators have undoubtedly experimented with VR-focused video and have gotten tied up in the frustrations. While the number of headsets is still growing, it’s still not enough that VR viewers can sustain a channel, and while VR180 videos are visible in “magic window” mode without a headset as well on mobile and desktop, it obviously loses the 3D capability as a result, which is kind of the biggest draw.Germany’s justice minister has written to Facebook calling for the platform to implement an internal “control and sanction mechanism” to ensure third-party developers and other external providers are not able to misuse Facebook data — calling for it to both monitor third party compliance with its platform policies and apply “harsh penalties” for any violations.

The letter, which has been published in full in local media, follows the privacy storm that has engulfed the company since mid March when fresh revelations were published by the Observer of London and the New York Times — detailing how Cambridge Analytica had obtained and used personal information on up to 87 million Facebook users for political ad targeting purposes.

Writing to Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, justice minister Katarina Barley welcomes some recent changes the company has made around user privacy, describing its decision to limit collaboration with “data dealers” as “a good start”, for example.

However she says the company needs to do more — setting out a series of what she describes as “core requirements” in the area of data and consumer protection (bulleted below).

She also writes that the Cambridge Analytica scandal confirms long-standing criticisms against Facebook made by data and consumer advocates in Germany and Europe, adding that it suggests various lawsuits filed against the company’s data practices have “good cause”.

“Unfortunately, Facebook has not responded to this criticism in all the years or only insufficiently,” she continues (translated via Google Translate). “Facebook has rather expanded its data collection and use. This is at the expense of the privacy and self-determination of its users and third parties.”

“What is needed is that Facebook lives up to its corporate responsibility and makes a serious change,” she says at the end of the letter. “In interviews and advertisements, you have stated that the new EU data protection regulations are the standard worldwide for the social network. Whether Facebook consistently implements this view, unfortunately, seems questionable,” she continues, critically flagging Facebook’s decision to switch the data controller status of ~1.5BN international users this month so they will no longer be under the jurisdiction of EU law, before adding: “I will therefore keep a close eye on the further measures taken by Facebook.“

Since revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data snowballed into a global privacy scandal for the company this spring, the company has revealed a series of changes which it claims are intended to bolster data protection on its platform.

Although, in truth, many of the tweaks Facebook has announced were likely in train already — as it has been working for months (if not years) on its response to the EU’s incoming GDPR framework, which will apply from May 25.

Yet, even so, many of these measures have been roundly criticized by privacy experts, who argue they do not go far enough to comply with GDPR and will trigger legal challenges once the framework is being applied.

For example, a new consent flow, announced by Facebook last month, has been accused of being intentionally manipulative — and of going against the spirit of the new rules, at very least.

Barley picks up on these criticisms in her letter — calling specifically for Facebook to deliver:

More transparency for users

Real control of users’ data processing by Facebook

Strict compliance with privacy by default and consent in the entire ecosystem of Facebook

Objective, neutral, non-discriminatory and manipulation-free algorithms

More freedom of choice for users through various settings and uses

On consent, she emphasizes that under GDPR the company will need to obtain consent for each data use — and cannot bundle up uses to try to obtain a ‘lump-sum’ consent, as she puts it.

Yet this is pretty clearly exactly what Facebook is doing when it asks Europeans to opt into its face recognition technology, for example, by suggesting this could help protect users against strangers using their photos; and be an aid to visually impaired users on its platform; yet there’s absolutely no specific examples in the consent flow of the commercial uses to which Facebook will undoubtedly put the tech.

The minister also emphasizes that GDPR demands a privacy-by-default approach, and requires data collection to be minimized — saying Facebook will need to adapt all of its data processing operations in order to comply.

Any data transfers from “friends” should also only take place with explicit consent in individual cases, she continues (consent that was of course entirely lacking in 2014 when Facebook APIs allowed a developer on its platform to harvest data on up to 87 million users — and pass the information to Cambridge Analytica).

Barley also warns explicitly that Facebook must not create shadow profiles, an especially awkward legal issue for Facebook which US lawmakers also questioned Zuckerberg closely about last month.

Facebook’s announcement this week, at its f8 conference, of an incoming Clear History button — which will give users the ability to clear past browsing data the company has gathered about them — merely underscores the discrepancies here, with tracked Facebook non-users not even getting this after-the-fact control, although tracked users also can’t ask Facebook never to track them in the first place.

Nor is it clear what Facebook does with any derivatives it gleans from this tracked personal data — i.e. whether those insights are also dissociated from an individual’s account.

Sure, Facebook might delete a web log of the sites you visited — like a gambling site or a health clinic — when you hit the button but that does not mean it’s going to remove all the inferences it’s gleaned from that data (and added to the unseen profile it holds of you and uses for ad targeting purposes).

Safe to say, the value of the Clear History button looks mostly as PR for Facebook — so the company can point to it and claim it’s offering users another ‘control’ as a strategy to try to deflect lawmakers’ awkward questions (just such disingenuousness was on ample show in Congress last month — and has also been publicly condemned by the UK parliament).

We asked Facebook our own series of questions about how Clear History operates, and why — for example — it is not offering users the ability to block tracking entirely. After multiple emails on this topic, over two days, we’re still waiting for the company to answer anything we asked.

Facebook’s processing of non-users’ data, collected via tracking pixels and social plugins across other popular web services, has already got Facebook into hot water with some European regulators. Under GDPR it will certainly face fresh challenges to any consent-less handling of people’s data — unless it radically rethinks its approach, and does so in less than a month.

In her letter, Barley also raises concerns around the misuse of Facebook’s platform for political influence and opinion manipulation — saying it must take “all necessary technical and organizational measures to prevent abuse and manipulation possibilities (e.g. via fake accounts and social bots)”, and ensure the algorithms it uses are “objective, neutral and non-discriminatory”.

She says she also wants the company to disclose the actions it takes on this front in order to enable “independent review”.

Facebook’s huge sprawl and size — with its business consisting of multiple popular linked platforms (such as WhatsApp and Instagram), as well as the company deploying its offsite tracking infrastructure across the Internet to massively expand the reach of its ecosystem — “puts a special strain on the privacy and self-determination of German and European users”, she adds.

At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to multiple requests for comment about the letter.Today is the day Google makes good on a lot of its 2017 I/O VR promises. The company just announced that it will be open sourcing Seurat, a tool designed to reduce complexity in high-fidelity mobile VR scenes, improving performance considerably.

This launch arrives alongside the release of the Mirage Solo, the first headset on the Daydream VR platform to make use of Google’s WorldSense positional tracking system. The headset is standalone and runs on a mobile chipset so it’s a lot more resource-constrained than headsets that connect to gaming PCs.

Seurat is a software tool that aims to reduce polygon count. Basically, Seurat takes all of the possible viewpoints that a VR user may have given their limited range of movement and removes the area of the 3D environment that they’d never be able to see. Seurat removes object permanence from the equation, so if you can’t see it in virtual reality, chances are it doesn’t actually exist at all.

In the snippet above from a new Blade Runner title, Google says the Seurat program was able to take a scene with 46.6 million triangles and reduce it down to 307,000. This is especially useful for developers with existing renders that they’re porting from more capable hardware to the more strained mobile VR hardware.

Source code and documentation for the tool is available on its GitHub page.Google announced on Friday a new set of policies around how it will verify election advertisers in the U.S. Specifically, any advertiser who want to buy an election ad on Google in the U.S. will now have to go through additional verification to prove they are a citizen or lawful permanent resident, as required by law. This process will involve having to provide a government-issued I.D. and other key information, Google says, and will roll out this week.

It will also require that ads include a clear disclosure of who is paying, as a part of the new requirements.

The change to how Google handles election-related advertising follows a commitment the company made last year to make political advertising more transparent, in response to evidence that Russia used social media and online ads in an attempt to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Another part of those promised changes – a new Transparency Report focused on election ads – will arrive later this summer. The report will detail who’s buying election ads and how much they spent. Google says it’s building a searchable library for election ads, where anyone can look up this information, as well.

The move is a first step towards Google making U.S. election advertising on the web, but only addresses ads about candidates running for office – not “issue ads.” Facebook, by comparison, had announced a similar procedure for election ads in October, then followed up by expanding it to “issue ads” in April. The issue ads are those that address a hotly debated political topic, not just those ads tied to a candidate.

Facebook says it will now work to label these as “political ads” on its network, display the “paid for” information to users, and verify the identity and address of advertisers.

Google today is saying it will do the same in the future, and expand coverage to more elections.

“As we learn from these changes and our continued engagement with leaders and experts in the field, we’ll work to improve transparency of political issue ads and expand our coverage to a wider range of elections,” wrote Google general counsel Kent Walker, in a blog post.

The post also highlighted other actions Google is taking, including the development of a range of Protect Your Election tools created by Alphabet’s Jigsaw to help those at risk of online attacks; and yesterday’s expansion of Google’s Advanced Protection program, which offers enhanced security for data stored in Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. (The protection is now available for Apple’s native iOS apps like Mail, Calendar and Contacts.)

Walker added that more changes to how Google handles political ads were still to come.

“We are continuing that work through our efforts to increase election advertising transparency, to improve online security for campaigns and candidates, and to help combat misinformation,” he wrote. “Stay tuned for more announcements in the coming months.”The volume of data particle physicists have to sort through at the Large Hadron Collider is staggering, and it’s about to increase by an order of magnitude. To cope with this torrent of data, CERN is turning to machine learning, offering prizes for AI models that can cut through the clutter and help make the next breakthrough.

Inside the massive detectors that dot the rings of the LHC, protons accelerated to near light speed smash into each other with incredible energy and produce a fountain of exotic, short-lived particles that impact on sensors lining the walls. Improvements being made to the magnetic fields guiding these protons around the ring mean that where once you could expect a couple dozen collisions to draw data from, soon there may be hundreds.

Great for the scientists, but with more collisions comes more data, in this case an order of magnitude more. The old methods of sorting and categorizing the data are too slow, researchers told Nature. So they’re doing what any modern data scientist would do when faced with a massive set of noisy data: hand it over to the AIs.

I use the term loosely, of course — machine learning models are just really great at chewing through reams of data in search of what they’ve been trained to find. Medicine, astronomy and, of course, psychology (courtesy of Facebook) have all been advanced by this convenient ability to separate the statistical wheat from the chaff. Particle physics is just another example of it.

A little healthy competition, as always, is a good way to jump-start the field. So CERN established TrackML, a relatively low-key contest in which physicists and data scientists can download gigs of real collider data and train up models to classify it correctly. Of course, there are terabytes available for the picking, but you’ll want to use this particular data set.

The prize pool is relatively small, with a total of $25,000 available to the winners. Perhaps they used up all their money on… you know, upgrading the world’s biggest particle collider with state of the art cryomagnets.

There’s no entry fee, so if you’re interested in giving it a shot, head over to Kaggle, where the contest is hosted, and download your own copy of the data. You’ve got plenty of time — submissions are due in August. Oh, and anything you submit will be open sourced, so don’t worry that they’re going to commercialize your algorithm.A Waymo self-driving vehicle was involved in a serious accident in Chandler, Arizona earlier this afternoon. Local police said there were minor injuries from the incident after a sedan swerved into the Waymo van to avoid another collision.

Although Waymo has said it will be testing vehicles without safety drivers in Arizona, this was not one of them. An operator was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash, though the car was in autonomous mode, police said.

Aerial footage and images posted online by onlookers show that this was no fender-bender. The sedan’s front crumple zone is wrecked and glass is broken; the van is in better shape, though its front right tire is crushed in. Both vehicles have since been towed.

Reportedly the sedan was traveling eastbound and swerved to avoid another car at an intersection, straying into the westbound lanes and hitting the Waymo van. What actions if any the latter took to avoid the collision are unknown at this time, though an analysis by the company would of course provide that info. I’ve asked the company for comment and will update if I hear back.

Update: The police provided me with the following statement, which doesn’t add much but confirms the above:

We are currently investigating a minor injury collision involving two vehicles, one of which is a Waymo autonomous vehicle. This afternoon around noon a vehicle (Honda sedan) traveling eastbound on Chandler Blvd. had to swerve to avoid striking a vehicle traveling northbound on Los Feliz Dr. As the Honda swerved, the vehicle continued eastbound into the westbound lanes of Chandler Blvd. & struck the Waymo vehicle, which was traveling at a slow speed and in autonomous mode. There was an occupant in the Waymo vehicle sitting in the driver’s seat, who sustained minor injuries. Both the Waymo vehicle & the Honda were towed from the scene. This incident is still under investigation

Waymo has also posted video of the accident from the van’s point of view:Just ahead of Google’s big developer conference next week, Google I/O, the company has rolled out a new mobile app for its VR180 point-and-shoot cameras, allowing users to set up their device, view and manage clips, and upload photo and video content to Google Photos and YouTube. The app is arriving to kick off the launch of the Lenovo Mirage Solo, the first standalone virtual reality headset that runs Daydream, and the Lenovo Mirage Camera, both of which go on sale today.

At CES in January, Google had shown off new VR180 cameras including the Mirage, and one from a Chinese manufacturer Yi, called the Horizon.

You can read more about the Lenovo 3D camera here.

The name “VR180” refers to a new VR format for capturing 180-degree panoramic images, that was created through a collaboration between YouTube and Google’s Daydream VR division. The idea is that photographers could use these new cameras to capture photos and videos that are immersive, but don’t stretch all the way around in a full 360 degrees.

The content captured by the VR180 cameras includes 3D photos and ultra HD 4K resolution videos, but these can be viewed and shared in both 2D and 3D. To view them in VR, you can use a VR headset, like Google Cardboard, Daydream, or PlayStation VR.

The new VR180 app, which launched yesterday on both iOS and Android, according to data from Sensor Tower, is meant to support the VR180 cameras.

Explains the App Store description, the app lets you set up and manage your VR180 camera from your mobile device and can be used to capture 180-degree VR content with the camera using a “Live Preview” feature.

You can then transfer files to your phone or cloud – meaning Google Photos or YouTube. You can also use the app and camera to live stream to YouTube, the VR180 website explains.

And you can share clips directly with friends and family, or discard unwanted clips.

The app will also give you information about your camera’s status, like the battery charge, capture activity, available storage, and more.

The introduction of a simpler way to capture VR content – point-and-shoot cameras – is meant to encourage more people to try VR, and offer a new way of remembering moments in time. For example, the app store screenshots tout the camera’s personal use cases – for capturing things like videos from a wedding or of a mother with her baby.

The idea that VR will be used to create immersive re-creations of our memories that we can dive back into a later date is not unique to Google. Facebook this week also announced something called “VR Memories,” which will take your old photos then leverage computer vision to turn the flat 2D images and videos into spatial point clouds that can be explored in VR.

The game is played on a grid of boxes and includes “embodied” and non-embodied play. Embodied play means a robotic arm will grab and place a marker – in this case a small cup – and non-embodied play includes bright lights that light up to mark the computer’s spot.

The system uses a Kinova arm and cups. The cups are part of the rehabilitation process and help users learn to grasp and manipulate objects after an illness or accident.

“Playing Tic Tac Toe with a set of cups (instead of X’s and O’s) is one example of a game that can help rehabilitate an upper limb,” said Dr. Shelly Levy-Tzedek. “A person can pick up and place many cups while enjoying a game and improving their performance of a daily task.”

Interestingly the speed of the robot had an effect on the users. A slower robot would make users perform more slowly while a faster robot sped up the game. This could be used to modify the game for individual patients and individual needs. Because the robot never gets tired the rehabilitation staff can pay attention to the minute movements of a patient, catering the speed and type of play as appropriate for their specific rehabilitation regimens.

The research paper appeared in Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience.After a distributed denial-of-service attack knocked some servers offline during a local election in Tennessee this week, Knox County is working with an outside security contractor to investigate the cause. The attack took the Knox County Election Commission site displaying results of the county mayoral primary offline during Tuesday night voting. The county resorted to distributing printed results during the outage.

“Tonight, Our web servers suffered a successful denial of service attack,” Knox County wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night. “Election results were not affected, as our election machines are never connected to the Internet.”

The day after the incident, Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett reassured voters that the attack did not compromise the vote. Election systems that can go online are far less secure than systems that are not able to connect to the internet.

“Although the crash did not affect the vote tallies or the integrity of the election, this is not something that should happen,” Burchett said in a statement. “I want to know what happened, and I think an independent review will help to determine that so we can move forward and work to prevent similar issues in the future.”

Burchett disputed outside claims that his office had acted “prematurely” in dismissing any risk to the integrity of the Knox County vote, reiterating that the county’s voting system “is never connected to internet, never at risk.”

Hey, @srl @HuffPost, how about you actually call Knox Co. to ask about our process? Your Ohio-based "expert" should have said: "Gee, I don't know how their voting system works, so I shouldn't comment" Lazy journalism. voting system is never connected to internet, never at risk. https://t.co/n7Wr3SEfmA — Tim Burchett (@timburchett) May 3, 2018

In a report from Knox County’s IT Department, Director Dick Moran noted “extremely heavy and abnormal network traffic” consistent with a DDoS attack and observed that the IP addresses involved originated from both domestic and international locations. Moran drew a distinction between a DDoS attack that can knock servers offline and a hack intended to infiltrate systems or servers.

Sword & Shield Enterprise Security, a Knoxville-based security firm, has been contracted to conduct an analysis of the attack and “determine the exact nature” of the server’s time offline.

The county site that was affected by the attack only displayed results to the public, it did not receive or tabulate them. Still, DDoS attacks are sometimes used as a diversionary tactic to create chaos. TechCrunch has reached out to Sword & Shield with additional questions about the sophistication and extent of the attack.

Given its enhanced coordination with states as part of recent initiatives to secure national election systems, TechCrunch has also been in touch with Homeland Security about its role in providing support to Knox County and will update this story when we have more information.The National Security Agency revealed a huge increase in the amount of call metadata collected, from about 151 million call records in 2016 to more than 530 million last year — despite having fewer targets. But officials say nothing is different about the year but the numbers.

A transparency report issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shows numerous other fluctuations in the volume of surveillance conducted. Foreign surveillance-related, warrantless Section 702 content queries involving U.S. persons jumped from 5,288 to 7,512, for instance, and more citizens were “unmasked,” indicating a general increase in quantity.

On the other hand, the number of more invasive pen register/trace and tap orders dropped by nearly half, to 33, with even fewer targets — far less than the peak in 2014, when 135 orders targeted 516 people.

The biggest increase by far is the number of “call detail records” collected from service providers. Although the number of targets actually decreased from the previous year, from 42 to 40, the number of call records jumped from 151 million to 534 million, and search terms from 22,360 to 31,196.

Call detail records are things like which numbers were called and when, the duration of the call and so on — metadata, no content. But metadata can be just as revealing as content, since it can, for example, place a person near the scene of a crime, or establish that two people were connected even if the conversation they had was benign.

What do these increases mean? It’s hard to say. A spokesperson for the ODNI told Reuters that the government “has not altered the manner in which it uses its authority to obtain call detail records,” and that they “expect this number to fluctuate from year to year.” So according to them, it’s just a matter of quantity.

Because one target can yield hundreds or thousands of incidental sub-targets — people connected to the target whose call records will be requested and stored — it’s possible that 2017’s targets just had fatter, longer contact lists and deeper networks than 2016’s. Needless to say this explanation is unsatisfying.

Although the NSA’s surveillance apparatus was dealt a check with the 2013 Snowden leaks and subsequent half-hearted crackdowns by lawmakers, it clearly is getting back into its stride.The Chinese government is reportedly going to bat for ZTE over a seven-year ban that would have broad ranging consequences for the phone maker. According to a new report from Reuters, the subject was broached during a meeting with between senior Chinese and U.S. officials in Beijing this week.

The ban imposed by the Department of Commerce is the result of a violation against U.S. Iranian sanctions. ZTE pled guilty, agreeing to pay a fine and penalize employees. After the DOC insisted it failed to do the latter, it barred US companies from selling software or components to the phone maker for seven years. Between chip makers like Qualcomm and software providers including, most notably, Google, the restrictions will prove next to impossible for ZTE to circumvent.

For many, the steep penalty appears to be part of a larger looming trade war between the two countries that’s also found ZTE and Huawei caught in the crosshairs over ties to the Chinese government. U.S. officials, however, have insisted that the ban isn’t related to trade issues between the two countries.

Earlier this week, the Pentagon banned the sale of both companies’ phones on military bases — just the latest in a long line tough breaks here in the States. ZTE has largely weathered the broader U.S. spying concerns better, due in part to a broader footprint in the States than Huawei, but the company admitted that this latest ban would be downright devestating.

“The Denial Order will not only severely impact the survival and development of ZTE,” the company told TechCrunch, “but will also cause damages to all partners of ZTE including a large number of U.S. companies.”

ZTE has also reportedly been in talks with U.S. companies like Google and has suggested it will take judicial action, if necessary.Google Assistant is gaining some new capabilities thanks to a deal with Fandango that should make ordering movie tickets a quick and easy process. Simply tell Google Assistant that you want to buy some movie tickets and you’ll see what’s playing nearby; you can dial in the specificity to find out just what’s playing at a specific theater or at which theaters a particular flick is going to be.

The deal is going live on May the Fourth™ in honor of the Star Wars™ marketing holiday and the fact that advanced tickets for Solo: A Star Wars Story™ are going on sale today.

This functionality is something that’s been available on Siri, but Google Assistant allows you to make the purchase without downloading the Fandango app, which had pretty much negated most of the utility this feature had on Siri.

For now, this launch is just for Google Assistant on Android phones, but if you’re perplexingly a heavy user of the Google Assistant app on iOS, then you’ll be able to get your movie ticket ordering functionality sometime later this year.
