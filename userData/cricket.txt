Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a rectangular 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a target at each end called the wicket (a set of three wooden stumps upon which two bails sit). Each phase of play is called an innings, during which one team bats, attempting to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents bowl and field, attempting to minimise the number of runs scored. When each innings ends, the teams usually swap roles for the next innings (i.e. the team that previously batted will bowl/field, and vice versa). The teams each bat for one or two innings, depending on the type of match. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained (except when the result is not a win/loss result).Before a match begins, the two team captains meet on the pitch for the toss (of a coin), with the winner deciding which team will bat first. Two players from the batting side, and all eleven players from the bowling/fielding side, then enter the field, and play proceeds by a member of the fielding team, known as the bowler, delivering (i.e., bowling) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, which is guarded by one of the batsmen, known as the striker. The striker's role is to strike the ball well enough to score runs, if possible, while not being dismissed. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. The bowling team's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. A dismissed batsman, who is declared to be "out", must leave the field to be replaced by a teammate.The most common forms of dismissal are these: bowled, when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball and dislodges the bail(s); leg before wicket (lbw), when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat; and caught, when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground.Runs are scored by two main methods: either by hitting the ball hard enough for it to cross the boundary, or by the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball.Adjudication is performed on the field by two umpires, aided by a Third umpire and Match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers (one per team) who record all the match's statistical information including runs, dismissals, overs, etc.There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (i.e. 120 deliveries), to Test matches, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string.Historically, cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules are held in a code called the Laws of Cricket which is owned and maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.The sport is followed primarily in Australasia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa and the West Indies. Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, having won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country, and having been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others are baseball, golf, hockey, tennis, squash, and table tennis.[1] In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend.[2] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it".[3]It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period.[2] Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar; equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:[4][5][6]"Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies".Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c.1550 by boys in Surrey.[6] The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun "crosse" as "the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket" and the verb form "crosser" as "to play at cricket".[7][8]One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick".[4] In Old French, the word "criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[9] Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick (crook).[9] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word "krickstoel", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[10] According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase").[11] Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.[11]Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects. The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and all along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that, in shape, resembled a hockey stick; the batsman defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called "notches" because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[12][13][14]In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[15] This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening, Kent.[4][16] In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.[17]Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the century.[8] It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth.[18][19] The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be "profane" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds and/or gambling were involved.[20][21]According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a "great upsurge of sport after the Restoration" in 1660.[22] Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was in any case a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.[22] Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport.[23] Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players.[24] By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport which was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676.[25] A 1697 newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" played in Sussex "for fifty guineas apiece" – this is the earliest known reference to an important match.[26]The patrons, and other players from the social class known as the "gentry", began to classify themselves as "amateurs"[fn 1] to establish a clear distinction vis-à-vis the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities.[27] The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their "social inferiors" if they were to win their bets.[28] In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University – society insisted that such people were "officers and gentlemen" whose destiny was to provide leadership.[29] In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed somewhat more than actual expenditure and the derisive term "shamateur" was coined to describe the syndrome.[30][31]The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's national sport.[citation needed] Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.[32] Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury.[citation needed] The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season.[33] Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape.[34][citation needed]The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point.[citation needed] MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).[35]The 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial.[36] Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839.[37] In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890.[38]The most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865. It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain, de facto professional. Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional.[citation needed]The last two decades before the First World War have been called the "Golden Age of cricket". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.[39]Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia, the Caribbean, India, New Zealand, North America and South Africa.[40] In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada.[41] In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour.[42]The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in 1868.[43] In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia.[44]In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia.[citation needed] The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest.[45] Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.[citation needed]The inter-war years were dominated by Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batsman of all time.[citation needed] Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) before the Second World War and then Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000) in the post-war period.[46][47] South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the apartheid boycott.[48]Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant.[49] As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased.[50] The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971 and the governing International Cricket Council (ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975.[51] In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, made an immediate impact.[citation needed] On 22 June 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and 12th ICC full members, enabling them to play Test cricket.[52][53]In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.[54]Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each.[55] The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.[56]In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[57] The pitch is a flat surface 3 metres (9.8 ft) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.[58]As illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is in fact unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also in fact unlimited in length.[59]Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings.[60] Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match.[60] In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.[61][62] When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.[60] During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time.[60] The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.[55]The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn.[63] If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have "lost by n runs" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by n wickets", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batsmen have been dismissed) have won the match "by four wickets".[63]In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have "won by an innings and n runs", and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.[63]If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings. Such a match is called a "limited overs" or "one-day" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a "no-result" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.[63]In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue.[64] There have been instances of entire matches, even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled: for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia.[65]i) A used white ball. White balls are mainly used in limited overs cricket, especially in matches played at night, under floodlights (left).The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat is "on strike" at the other end (see next sub-section: Basic gameplay).The bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than four and one quarter inches (108 mm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (965 mm). There is no standard for the weight which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg).[66][67]The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 22.9 centimetres (9.0 in). The ball has a "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable, and during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will therefore attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball tampering.[68]During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Two of the players are batsmen and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion. The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch. The photo was taken during an international match between Australia and Sri Lanka; Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka is bowling to Australian batsman Adam Gilchrist.In the photo, the two batsmen (3 & 8; wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6). Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot. One of the two umpires (1; wearing white hat) is stationed behind the wicket (2) at the bowler's (4) end of the pitch. The bowler (4) is bowling the ball (5) from his end of the pitch to the batsman (8) at the other end who is called the "striker". The other batsman (3) at the bowling end is called the "non-striker". The wicket-keeper (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9) and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called "first slip" (11). While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).While the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called "square leg", so that he is in line with the popping crease (7) at the striker's end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or, at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring runs. The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs.Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling so are termed all-rounders. Adam Gilchrist, pictured above, was a wicket-keeper/batsman, another type of all-rounder. Bowlers are also classified according to their style, generally as fast bowlers, medium pace seam bowlers or, like Muttiah Muralitharan pictured above, spinners. Batsmen are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.[69]If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain. The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.[70] The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers[71], a situation that first occurred when Mumbai Indians' wicket-keeper Ishan Kishan was injured in a match on 18 April 2018.[72]The captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman, a bowler or a wicket-keeper. Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves "within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws".[55]The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the "keeper") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour. He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.[73] Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers. Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper.[74][75]The wicket-keeper and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area).[76] Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.[69]Subject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woollen pullover (if needed); cricket cap (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead.[77]The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term defined by the Laws: "at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in".[60] In this situation, one of the batsman has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress.An innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:[60]The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls".[78] The name "over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a "spell". The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice-versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at "square leg" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice-versa.[78]The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg" which is about 15–20 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities including: adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase "How's that?" or "Owzat?"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.[64]Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.[64]The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.[79]A match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches.[80] According to Rowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T. Pratt of Sevenoaks and soon came into general use.[81] It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846.[82]Besides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the "Spirit of the Game" and the Preamble to the Laws, first published in the 2000 code, opens with this statement:[83]"Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it should be played not only within its Laws but also within the Spirit of the Game".The onus for ensuring that a team complies is placed firmly on the captain who may be required by the umpires to "take action" against any player on his team whose behaviour is unacceptable and may bring the sport into disrepute.[83] The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required to intervene if players are inter alia wasting time, damaging the pitch, tampering with the ball or showing disrespect to other players or to the umpires themselves.[83]Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally. The specialist bowlers are active multiple times during an innings, but may not bowl two overs consecutively. If the captain wants a bowler to "change ends", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.[78]A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a "run-up" and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being "in play".[78] Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly.[85] Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e. curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot, for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[85] At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting himself out.[86] In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.[85]There are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed: five relatively common and five extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are bowled,[87] caught,[88] leg before wicket (lbw),[89] run out[90] and stumped.[91] Rare methods are hit wicket,[92] hit the ball twice,[93] obstructing the field,[94] handled the ball[95] and timed out.[96] The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision. If the batsman is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says "Out!"; otherwise, he will shake his head and say "Not out".[97] There is, effectively, an eleventh method of dismissal, retired out, which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.[98]Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible, when the captain officially nominates the team.[55] Substitute batsmen are not allowed.[70]A skilled batsman can use a wide array of "shots" or "strokes" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an "edge". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., "cut", "drive", "hook", "pull".[99]The batsman on strike (i.e. the "striker") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.[100]The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually "yes", "no" or "wait". More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[100] To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batsmen do not need to run.[101] Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of "overthrows" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.[100]Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called "sundries" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: no-ball, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules;[102] wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach;[103] bye, an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way;[104] leg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman's body, though not his bat.[104] If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.[102][103]Women's cricket was first recorded in Surrey in 1745.[105] International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between Australia and England in December 1934.[106] In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005).[106] In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England.[106]The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989.[106] The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket.[107] The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team.[108] In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies.[109]The table below lists the ICC full members and their national cricket boards:[110]Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into first-class cricket, limited overs cricket and, historically, single wicket cricket. The highest standard is Test cricket (always written with a capital "T") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above). Although the term "Test match" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes. The term "first-class", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.[112]Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day. There are two types: List A which normally allows fifty overs per team; and Twenty20 in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals (LOI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The first Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a "no result".[113][114]Single wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches generally qualify as important. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.[115]Most international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is The Ashes.The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy and ICC World Twenty20. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the ICC World Test Championship, has been proposed several times, and is currently planned to begin in 2019. The ICC maintains Test rankings, ODI rankings and T20 rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.Competitions for member nations of the ICC with Associate status include the ICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket matches, and the World Cricket League for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the ICC World Cup Qualifier.First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890.[38] The most successful club has been Yorkshire, who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) to 2017.[116]Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states.[117] New South Wales has the highest number of titles.The other ICC full members have national championship trophies called the Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament (Afghanistan); the National Cricket League (Bangladesh); the Ranji Trophy (India); the Inter-Provincial Championship (Ireland); the Plunket Shield (New Zealand); the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (Pakistan); the Currie Cup (South Africa); the Premier Trophy (Sri Lanka); the Shell Shield (West Indies); and the Logan Cup (Zimbabwe).The world's earliest known cricket match was a village cricket meeting in Kent which has been deduced from a 1640 court case recording a "cricketing" of "the Weald and the Upland" versus "the Chalk Hill" at Chevening "about thirty years since" (i.e., c.1611). Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th.[16]At the grassroots level, local club cricket is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular.[118] Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events.[119] The sport has numerous informal variants such as French cricket.[120]Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. It has, for example, influenced the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as "that's not cricket" (that's unfair), "had a good innings" (lived a long life) and "sticky wicket". "On a sticky wicket" (aka "sticky dog" or "glue pot")[121] is a metaphor[122] used to describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch.[123]Cricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including William Blake and Lord Byron.[124] Beyond a Boundary (1963), written by Trinidadian C. L. R. James, is often named the best book on any sport, ever written.[125]In the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler's Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale's The Cricketers (1948), which has been called "possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century."[126] French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s.[124] Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion.[124] Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan's cricket images[127] are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail's "World of Invention" stamp issue, which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[128]Cricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.[129] In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with "a code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game.[130] It is typically played on modified cricket fields.[131]In England, a number of association football clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months. Derby County was founded as a branch of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884;[132] Aston Villa (1874) and Everton (1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams.[133] Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground was, from 1854, the home of the Sheffield Cricket Club, and then of Yorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973.[134]In the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was credited with devising the baseball box score[135] (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events. The first box score appeared in an 1859 issue of the Clipper.[136] The statistical record is so central to the game's "historical essence" that Chadwick is sometimes referred to as "the Father of Baseball" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days.[137]Related sportsOrganisations and competitionsStatistics and recordsNews and other resourcescricket is a bat and ball

hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground runs are scored by two main methods  either by hitting the ball hard enough for it to cross the boundary  or by the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball adjudication is performed on the field by two

groups  of  club ball  games  the  hockey group   in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets  the goals   the  golf group   in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target  the hole   and the  cricket group   in which  the ball is aimed at a mark  the wicket  and driven away from it     it is generally believed that cricket originated as a children s game in the south eastern counties of england  sometime during the medieval period     although there are claims for prior dates  the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in guildford on monday     january       julian calendar  equating to    january      in the gregorian calendar   the case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a    year old coroner  john derrick  who gave witness that           being a scholler in the ffree schoole of guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies  given derrick s age  it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c      by boys in surrey     the view that it was originally a children s game is reinforced by randle cotgrave s      english french dictionary in which he defined the noun  crosse  as  the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket  and the verb form  crosser  as  to play at cricket        one possible source for the sport s name is the old english word  cryce   or  cricc   meaning a crutch or staff  in samuel johnson s dictionary

chase        gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of flemish origin     although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs  the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects  the ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and all along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that  in shape  resembled a hockey stick  the batsman defended a low  two stump wicket  and runs were called  notches  because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks             in       the year

side s first innings total  the team with the greater score is then said to have  won by an innings and n runs   and does not need to bat again  n is the difference between the two teams  aggregate scores  if the team batting last is all out  and both sides have scored the same number of runs  then the match is a tie  this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only    happening in first class matches from the earliest known instance in      until january       in the traditional form of the game  if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win  then the game is declared a draw     if the match has only a single innings per side  then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings  such a match is called a  limited overs  or  one day  match  and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost  so that a draw cannot occur  if this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather  then a complex mathematical formula  known as the duckworth lewis method after its developers  is often used to recalculate a new target score  a one day match can also be declared a  no result  if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team  in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible  for example  wet weather     in all forms of cricket  the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue      there have been instances of entire matches  even test matches scheduled to be played over five days  being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled  for example  the third test of the         series in australia     i  a used white ball  white balls are mainly used in limited overs cricket  especially in matches played at night  under floodlights  left  the essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers  i e   bowls  the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who  armed with a bat is  on strike  at the other end  see next sub section  basic gameplay  the bat is made of wood  usually salix alba  white willow   and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle  the blade must not be more than four and one quarter inches      mm  wide and the total length of the bat not more than    inches      mm   there is no standard for the weight which is usually between   lb   oz and   lb      and     kg          the ball is a hard leather seamed spheroid  with a circumference of      centimetres      in   the ball has a  seam   six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior  the seam on a new ball is prominent  and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner  during matches  the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable  and during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match  players will therefore attempt to modify the ball s behaviour by modifying its physical properties  polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal  even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball s swing through the air  but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball  scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball tampering     during normal play  thirteen players and two umpires are on the field  two of the players are batsmen and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team  the other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion  the image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch  the photo was taken during an international match between australia and sri lanka  muttiah muralitharan of sri lanka is bowling to australian batsman adam gilchrist in the photo  the two batsmen         wearing yellow  have taken position at each end of the pitch      three members of the fielding team              wearing dark blue  are in shot  one of the two umpires     wearing white hat  is stationed behind the wicket     at the bowler s     end of the pitch  the bowler     is bowling the ball     from his end of the pitch to the batsman     at the other end who is called the  striker   the other batsman     at the bowling end is called the  non striker   the wicket keeper       who is a specialist  is positioned behind the striker s wicket     and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called  first slip        while the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only  the two batsmen and the wicket keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets  padded gloves and leg guards  pads  while the umpire     in shot stands at the bowler s end of the pitch  his colleague stands in the outfield  usually in or near the fielding position called  square leg   so that he is in line with the popping crease     at the striker s end of the pitch  the bowling crease  not numbered  is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases       the bowler     intends to hit the wicket     with the ball     or  at least  to prevent the striker     from scoring runs  the striker     intends  by using his bat  to defend his wicket and  if possible  to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs some players are skilled in both batting and bowling so are termed all rounders  adam gilchrist  pictured above  was a wicket keeper batsman  another type of all rounder  bowlers are also classified according to their style  generally as fast bowlers  medium pace seam bowlers or  like muttiah muralitharan pictured above  spinners  batsmen are classified according to whether they are right handed or left handed of the eleven fielders  three are in shot in the image above  the other eight are elsewhere on the field  their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler  fielders often change position between deliveries  again as directed by the captain or bowler     if a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match  a substitute is allowed to field instead of him  but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain  the substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return      the laws of cricket were updated in      to allow substitutes to act as wicket keepers      a situation that first occurred when mumbai indians  wicket keeper ishan kishan was injured in a match on    april          the captain is often the most experienced player in the team  certainly the most tactically astute  and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman  a bowler or a wicket keeper  within the laws  the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves  within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the laws      the wicket keeper  sometimes called simply the  keeper   is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the laws about his equipment and demeanour  he is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards      depending on their primary skills  the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers  generally  a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers  plus the wicket keeper         the wicket keeper and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball  which can be delivered at speeds of more than     kilometres per hour     mph  and presents a major health and safety concern  protective clothing includes pads  designed to protect the knees and shins   batting gloves or wicket keeper s gloves for the hands  a safety helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers  to protect the crotch area       some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads  arm pads  rib protectors and shoulder pads  the only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman  i e   if they are alongside or in front of him   but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards     subject to certain variations  on field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves  long trousers  woollen pullover  if needed   cricket cap  for fielding  or a safety helmet  and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction  the kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in test and first class cricket but  in limited overs cricket  team colours are worn instead     the innings  ending with  s  in both singular and plural form  is the term used for each phase of play during a match  depending on the type of match being played  each team has either one or two innings  sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but  for various reasons  an innings can end before they have all done so  the innings terminates if the batting team is  all out   a term defined by the laws   at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman  further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in       in this situation  one of the batsman has not been dismissed and is termed not out  this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress an innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen     the laws state that  throughout an innings   the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of   balls       the name  over  came about because the umpire calls  over   when six balls have been bowled  at this point  another bowler is deployed at the other end  and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not  a bowler cannot bowl two successive overs  although a bowler can  and usually does  bowl alternate overs  from the same end  for several overs which are termed a  spell   the batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over  and so the one who was non striker is now the striker and vice versa  the umpires also change positions so that the one who was at  square leg  now stands behind the wicket at the non striker s end and vice versa     the game on the field is regulated by the two umpires  one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler s end  the other in a position called  square leg  which is about       metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard  the umpires have several responsibilities including  adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled  i e   not a no ball or a wide   when a run is scored  whether a batsman is out  the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire  usually with the phrase  how s that   or  owzat     when intervals start and end  and the suitability of the pitch  field and weather for playing the game  the umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players  such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light     off the field in televised matches  there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence  the third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for test and limited overs international matches played between two icc full member countries  these matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the laws and the spirit of the game     the match details  including runs and dismissals  are recorded by two official scorers  one representing each team  the scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire  see image  right   for example  the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out  has been dismissed   he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs  the scorers are required by the laws to record all runs scored  wickets taken and overs bowled  in practice  they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game     a match s statistics are summarised on a scorecard  prior to the popularisation of scorecards  most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches      according to rowland bowen  the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in      by t  pratt of sevenoaks and soon came into general use      it is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at lord s for the first time in          besides observing the laws  cricketers must respect the  spirit of the game  and the preamble to the laws  first published in the      code  opens with this statement      cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it should be played not only within its laws but also within the spirit of the game  the onus for ensuring that a team complies is placed firmly on the captain who may be required by the umpires to  take action  against any player on his team whose behaviour is unacceptable and may bring the sport into disrepute      the umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play  they are required to intervene if players are inter alia wasting time  damaging the pitch  tampering with the ball or showing disrespect to other players or to the umpires themselves     most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler  although some are all rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally  the specialist bowlers are active multiple times during an innings  but may not bowl two overs consecutively  if the captain wants a bowler to  change ends   another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate     a bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a  run up  and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run up for the first delivery of that over  the ball then being  in play       fast bowlers  needing momentum  take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling  the fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over     kilometres per hour     mph  and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman  who is forced to react very quickly      other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing  i e  curve  in flight  this type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot  for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be  caught behind  by the wicket keeper or a slip fielder      at the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman  a spinner will often  buy his wicket  by  tossing one up   in a slower  steeper parabolic path  to lure the batsman into making a poor shot  the batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often  flighted  or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be  trapped  into getting himself out      in between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman s concentration     there are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed  five relatively common and five extremely rare  the common forms of dismissal are bowled      caught      leg before wicket  lbw       run out     and stumped      rare methods are hit wicket      hit the ball twice      obstructing the field      handled the ball     and timed out      the laws state that the fielding team  usually the bowler in practice  must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision  if the batsman is out  the umpire raises a forefinger and says  out    otherwise  he will shake his head and say  not out       there is  effectively  an eleventh method of dismissal  retired out  which is not an on field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited     batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires  though the order remains flexible  when the captain officially nominates the team      substitute batsmen are not allowed     a skilled batsman can use a wide array of  shots  or  strokes  in both defensive and attacking mode  the idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat s blade  if the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an  edge   the batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper  equally  he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat  batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible  and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply  blocking  the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run  a wide variety of shots are played  the batsman s repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed  e g    cut    drive    hook    pull      the batsman on strike  i e  the  striker   must prevent the ball hitting the wicket  and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball  to register a run  both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies  the batsmen carry their bats as they run   each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker      the decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball s progress  and this is communicated by calling  usually  yes    no  or  wait   more than one run can be scored from a single hit  hits worth one to three runs are common  but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more       to compensate for this  hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary  in these cases the batsmen do not need to run       hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of  overthrows  by a fielder returning the ball  if an odd number of runs is scored by the striker  the two batsmen have changed ends  and the one who was non striker is now the striker  only the striker can score individual runs  but all runs are added to the team s total      additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras  called  sundries  in australia  due to errors made by the fielding side  this is achieved in four ways  no ball  a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules       wide  a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman s reach       bye  an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way       leg bye  as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman s body  though not his bat       if the bowler has conceded a no ball or a wide  his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball  i e   delivery  has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball           women s cricket was first recorded in surrey in            international development began at the start of the   th century and the first test match was played between australia and england in december            in       the international women s cricket council was founded  it merged with the icc in             in       the first cricket world cup of any kind took place when a women s world cup was held in england      the international cricket council  icc   which has its headquarters in dubai  is the global governing body of cricket  it was founded as the imperial cricket conference in      by representatives from england  australia and south africa  renamed the international cricket conference in       and took up its current name in            the icc in      has     member nations  twelve of which hold full membership and can play test cricket       the icc is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket s major international tournaments  notably the men s and women s versions of the cricket world cup  it also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned test matches  limited overs internationals and twenty   internationals each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country  selects the national squad  and organises home and away tours for the national team       in the west indies  which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations  these matters are addressed by cricket west indies      the table below lists the icc full members and their national cricket boards      cricket is a multi faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into first class cricket  limited overs cricket and  historically  single wicket cricket  the highest standard is test cricket  always written with a capital  t   which is in effect the international version of first class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the icc  see above   although the term  test match  was not coined until much later  test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between australia and england in the         australian season  since       most test series between england and australia have been played for a trophy known as the ashes  the term  first class   in general usage  is applied to top level domestic cricket  test matches are played over five days and first class over three to four days  in all of these matches  the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result      limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day  there are two types  list a which normally allows fifty overs per team  and twenty   in which the teams have twenty overs each  both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as limited overs internationals  loi  and twenty   internationals  t  i   list a was introduced in england in the      season as a knockout cup contested by the first class county clubs  in       a national league competition was established  the concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in       in       the first cricket world cup took place in england  twenty   is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours  usually in an evening session  the first twenty   world championship was held in       limited overs matches cannot be drawn  although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a  no result            single wicket was popular in the   th and   th centuries and its matches generally qualify as important  in this form  although each team may have from one to six players  there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts  single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began  matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first class one and they could end in a draw      most international matches are played as parts of  tours   when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months  and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation  sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the test series  the most famous of which is the ashes the icc also organises competitions that are for several countries at once  including the cricket world cup  icc champions trophy and icc world twenty    a league competition for test matches played as part of normal tours  the icc world test championship  has been proposed several times  and is currently planned to begin in       the icc maintains test rankings  odi rankings and t   rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket competitions for member nations of the icc with associate status include the icc intercontinental cup  for first class cricket matches  and the world cricket league for one day matches  the final matches of which now also serve as the icc world cup qualifier first class cricket in england is played for the most part by the    county clubs which contest the county championship  the concept of a champion county has existed since the   th century but the official competition was not established until           the most successful club has been yorkshire  who had won    official titles  plus one shared  to           australia established its national first class championship in         when the sheffield shield was introduced  in australia  the first class teams represent the various states       new south wales has the highest number of titles the other icc full members have national championship trophies

cricket match was a village cricket meeting in kent which has been deduced from a      court case recording a  cricketing  of  the weald and the upland  versus  the chalk hill  at chevening  about thirty years since   i e   c        inter parish contests became popular in the first half of the   th century and continued to develop through the   th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the   th     at the grassroots level  local club cricket is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening  schools cricket  first known in southern england in the   th century  has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular       although there can be variations in game format  compared with professional cricket  the laws are always observed and club school matches are therefore formal and competitive events       the sport has numerous informal variants such as french cricket      cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture  both in the commonwealth of nations and elsewhere  it has  for example  influenced the lexicon of these nations  especially the english language  with various phrases such as  that s not cricket   that s unfair    had a good innings   lived a long life  and  sticky wicket    on a sticky wicket   aka  sticky dog  or  glue pot        is a metaphor      used to describe a difficult circumstance  it originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket  caused by a damp and soft pitch      cricket is the subject of works by noted english poets  including william blake and lord byron       beyond a boundary         written by trinidadian c  l  r  james  is often named the best book on

has close historical ties with australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports       in       prominent australian cricketer tom wills called for the formation of a  foot ball club  with  a code of laws  to keep cricketers fit during the off season  the melbourne football club was founded the following year  and wills and three other members codified the first
